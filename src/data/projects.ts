    to the checkout page and upon filling in a form for aunthetication and payment, you will have a popup modal
    confirming your purchase.
    React with typescript was used to build this, with tailwind for styling, react router for routing and redux
    toolkit for managing state. This was my first time using redux toolkit and i learnt the basics. It was also 
    the first time i used the modal element built into html, i still have quiet a lot to learn about it but this
    experience gave me much.`,
